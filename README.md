# Indian-flag
"JAI HIND" Friends I am sharing html file for creating flag using HTML and CSS. Indian flag made for HTML and CSS practice. 
Friends this is one of the question asked in the frontend interview by the intreviewer to me. I answered that how to do that. 
He asked me how to create a flag using just one div, the answer is very simple using before and after property of the css.
Never forget to use the 'content:"";' property in your style, otherwise the style will not work, and you will not get the result you want.
In this I have used the CSS rotate property I have also created a repo for centring a div with flex, grid and without flex and grid.
If you are preparing for your Frontend Interview please look to this or other documentation (https://github.com/Sompal4549/certerthediv).
